## üõ†Ô∏è TODO Features

- **Phone Support**  
  Display caller name and number. 
  (This is done, but needs additional input support for awnsering / hanging up calls)
  
- **Microphone Input**  
  Enable voice input and hands-free calling.
  
- **Fast Forward and Rewind**  
  Implement song skipping and replay functionality.
  (Needs to now be implemented on stereo frontend)
  
- **Equalizer Settings**  
  Expand on existing menu for custom audio adjustments. Including finding a novel way to do equalization with pulseaudio, purely through command line. 
  Note on this, `pactl load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=ladspa_out sink_master=@DEFAULT_SINK@ plugin=caps label=Eq10 control=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`
  
- **Brightness Fix for OLED 1309**  
  Resolve brightness control issues with the display. Seems im not the only one with this issue on this paticular board.

Additional Notes:
Current Stereo Trim is for a BMW E36, but device can be used as a indepedent stereo, will make custom faceplates upon request in the repo. üöóüé∂
This project assumes you have pulseaudio and the dac in a working state, with the dac set as the default sink, aswell as pulseaudio running on boot.
